## ABOUT

Down the winding road I've done many things, one could say I'm multi-creative. My creative side mirrors that I’m a person with a growth mindset. I believe in ever growing, ever learning as a being and creativity for me is essentially interdisciplinary problem solving and collaboration. I’m curious of people and try to increase my filter bubbles in life, digitally and in work. Illustrated already as a tattoo on me, for me team is everything so creating/facilitating good team cultures or collaboration is important. 

**Interest:** I enjoy reading a lot and it may vary between societal structures, ai, quantum physics, tech development, philosophy, psychology, cybersecurity, sexuality, work environments/cultures, just anything that makes me more understanding of the human dynamics and condition. 

**Believe in:** Direct style communication & understanding one anothers strenghts/weaknesses to create the most effective team. That creativity is all about interdisciplinary problem solving and connecting the dots. 

**Worked with:** Augify, ATP Atelier, VR Sverige AB, Isadeco, Life Lab, Eventopia, Gavagai, IKEA, Polestar, etc.etc.etc.
