Together with Eventopia we set the decor for the summer terrace of Cafe Opera. I set the colour scheme, the decor details, designed the wallpaper and even climbed all around it to set it all up. #worker

Together with the fantastic concept designer Robert Bohman, I assisted on several decor assignments. Most prominent being the Christmas decor but also including the interior decor for the terrace and the restaurant of Mister French.

I also had an amazing time about how one can get into BDSM and what that can mean for one, with Saga Alm Mårtensson - a sexologist & CBT therapist I admire. It was for her online show - "I säng med Saga" for Aftonbladet TV.
